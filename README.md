## Choose Financial Simplicity Over Short-Term Optimization

Thinking
- Short-term financial optimizations (high interest rates, sign-up bonuses, promotional offers) typically even out over time and often come with hidden costs.
- The mental overhead and time spent managing multiple accounts and optimization strategies outweighs the marginal benefits.
- Financial institutions design "optimization opportunities" to increase their profits, not yours.
- Simplicity in financial management leads to better long-term decisions and reduced stress.

Examples
- I maintain accounts at only two banks rather than spreading across multiple institutions for marginally better rates.
- I don't sign up for new credit cards to get sign-up bonuses.
- I use GIRO for automatic card payments instead of manually paying each month to maximize float.
- I use a single credit card for most purchases rather than juggling multiple cards to optimize category-specific rewards.
- I avoid investment products with tiered fee structures, lock-in periods, or complicated withdrawal conditions.
